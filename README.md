Payflow Payment Gateway handles all major credit and debit cards inline. https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/payflow-payment-gateway while "Express Checkout" is a modal paypal form.  Neither solution has users leaving your checkout process.

> **International Payments** Make sure you check the PayPal documentation for which countries are supported. Express Checkout supports more countries than PayFlow.
